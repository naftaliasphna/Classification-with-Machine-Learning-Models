# Classification-with-Machine-Learning-Models
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the scikit-learn dataset. The tested models include SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Na√Øve Bayes, compared to determine the best performance in breast cancer classification.
